  "summary": "A lightweight library that streamlines interacting with the Firebase/Auth library on iOS, written in Swift.",
  "description": "The purpose of this library is to make building custom frontend UI around the Firebase Authentication\nservice easier on iOS for those of us that do not want to use the FirebaseUI library. It does this by implementing\nstandard authentication workflows and error handling (i.e. account linking, profile updates, set/update password, reauthentication,\nenabling/disabling thrid-party providers, account deletion, auto-retry, etc.). This is done by abstracting away\na lot of the error handling logic into a singleton state machine ('AuthManager') cabable of handling most Firebase\nauthentication use cases.",
